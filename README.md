# WriteRightDraw

A card game that is a mix of rummikub and mad libs (Still in development but planning on using React and socket.io)

The game would start off by grabbing a random word (verb, preposition, or noun) from a dictionary api. This random word would be added to a player's played cards pile. And this would also happen for each player.
